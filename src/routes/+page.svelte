<p class="font-book text-sbb p-4 ">This book journal idea started originally from when I was sixteen and bored in lockdown. Reading is a very strong passion of mine and I often share my thoughts and recommendations to my close friends. Because of this, I decided one day with my endless amounts of time to create an extensive spreadsheet with everything there was to know about the book regarding the author (in alphabetical order), genre, publisher, number of pages, isbn, and if it was a paperback or hard cover. With this information I used it to track my growing library and the books I had read. Now for this project I decided to give this idea a bit of a face lift and make it into a webpage that I plan on becoming a passion project outside of this program. Goals of mine are to turn this webpage into an app that my friends and I can journal our thoughts, catalouge our library and host book clubs through. </p>
